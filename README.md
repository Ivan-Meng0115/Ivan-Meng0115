- #### 👋  Hi, I’m Ivan Meng, an undergraduate student in the Red McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS) and minoring in Scientific Computation and Data Analytics.

- #### 👀  I’m interested in bridging the gap between technology and business and currently looking for Data Analyst, Business Intelligence, and Consulting internships and jobs.

- #### 👨🏻‍💻  I have experience using SQL, R, Python, and Tableau to work on several data related projects and assignments such as predictive models for forecasting, customer clustering for marketing strategies. 

- #### 🏓  Outside school, I am a professional table tennis player and a private coach.  I have won multiple national and international championships in the US and China, and represented UT Austin attending the US Collegiate Table Tennis tournaments with my UT Austin team members.  I also trained 4 young players in TX to win several national titles of their age groups.
